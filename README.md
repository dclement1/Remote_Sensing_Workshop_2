# Shelburne Falls, MA, U.S.A.
### For this project I wanted to look at the flood risk posed by the Deerfield River, on the town of Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts. This town has been affected in the past by flood events, and having a better picture of specific areas which could be problematic in future flood events, could be extremely beneficial.
